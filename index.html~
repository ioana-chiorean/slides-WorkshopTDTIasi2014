Explain that without Mozilla, Internet Explorer would be the dominant browser,
      that we are a not-for-profit organisation to keep the web open and that without
      us the web would be a corporate-only environment. Firefox (and Opera) also paved the way for other browsers both to be released
        open source and support web standards. Even IE now does a lot to support and
        also promote web standards.

                    to identify yourself with one of your verified e-mails. That way you don't have to
                    have thousands of profiles online and you only give sites the information you want

                    One very obvious change in the last years was that the web became much more mobile.
                    Instead of desktop machines we use laptops, smart phones and tablets and all of
                    these devices get more powerful by the month. They all come with different resolutions
                    and connectivity issues, though and Mozilla is happy to take on the challenge of
                    moving the open web from immobile machines to on-the-go computing.

                    power smartphones we were very happy and interested indeed. Finally
                    web standards got a platform that is on the bleeding edge and very
                    beautiful and we all were ready to chip in to make this an open

                    However, when native apps took off a lot of companies realised that there
                    is money to be made by not keeping things open. Apps can do more than
                    HTML5 can because the OS and hardware providers grant them more access and
                    control the experience. If you control the software and the hardware, you
                    can build great, but very bespoke products. If you allow for open technologies
                    to be used, you lose control and you make less money as a hardware provider.
                    As a developer, you shouldn't have to go that route.

                    Instead of resizing the window you resize the document in the browser. It comes
                    with lots of presets of the sizes of common phones and tablets and you still
                    have access to all the buttons and tabs of your browser.

                    of having to send code, restart the phone or reload the page and all
                    that pain. With remote debugging you can see what is going on in the
                    code of your HTML5 app on your desktop while testing it in the real
                    environment.

                    The most frustrating part about this is that phone and operating

                    to use in a smartphone are the camera, the sensors and to use it
                    to send messages to your friends and call people. To do this,
                    however you'll need to write native code. Browsers, in general
                    are locked out. This is not fair when you claim at the same
                    time that HTML5 is the platform to bring a great future.

                    One very obvious change in the last years was that the web became much more mobile.
                    Instead of desktop machines we use laptops, smart phones and tablets and all of
                    these devices get more powerful by the month. They all come with different resolutions
                    and connectivity issues, though and Mozilla is happy to take on the challenge of
                    moving the open web from immobile machines to on-the-go computing.

                    still should get the chance to be online on the go. These

                    Firefox OS is build with three components:
                    Gonk is the Linux layer talking to the hardware (the same Android uses)
                    Gecko is the rendering and JavaScript engine (same as Firefox) and
                    Gaia is the interface - everything you see - written in HTML5

                    The whole interface of Firefox OS is written in web technologies. This
                    means phone or phone service providers can complete change the look,
                    feel and functionality of the phone interface itself. This is something
                    completely new and can lead to a lot of great phone innovation for
                    special needs. Consider a kid's phone with three simple buttons or
                    company phones that only have the apps you need for your job and nothing
                    else.

			<ul>
				<li>Run GAIA in Firefox Nightly (simplest way)</li>

                You can run Firefox OS on your own computer inside Firefox Nightly
                or with Desktop simulators.
                The easiest is to run it in the browser and build your apps for it
                with the environment you are familiar with.
                You can put it on your own phones but the process is not easy (yet)
                The idea of Firefox OS is to bring new, affordable web-enabled phones
                to people and not to replace Android/iOS.

                    Of course a phone without apps is not going to be very interesting to audiences 
                    out there. This is why Mozilla has its own app store that contains apps that can 
                    run on a Firefox OS phone but also in the browser. 
                    These apps are built with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and all you need to give us 
                    to be part of it is a manifest file.

                Firefox OS needs developers to help it out. You can contribute in many ways. 
                The easiest is to play with it and give us feedback as to what you'd want out 
                of it. Of course we love people to code with us, too, and we very much need 
                people to build apps on B2G.
